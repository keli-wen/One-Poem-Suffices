# One Poem Suffices

A blog series on **Agent Engineering** — deep dives into LLM and Agentic Systems. One article per topic, thorough enough that you only need to read it once.

### :material-robot: [Multi-Agent System](./multi-agent-system/)

> *"When intelligence reaches a certain threshold, multi-agent systems become the key to scaling performance."*

Anthropic found that multi-agent systems outperform single agents by **90.2%**. This article explores the paradigm shift from model intelligence to system intelligence, answering the core questions of What, Why, and How.

### :material-brain: [Context Engineering](./context-engineering/)

> *"Most AI Agent failures are not failures of model capability, but failures of context engineering."*

Context Engineering is a core skill for building production-grade AI Agents. This article digs into its essence — not "advanced Prompt Engineering", but a set of principles distilled from the evolution of Agentic Systems.

### :material-lightning-bolt: [Just-in-Time Context](./just-in-time-context/)

> *"From LLMs passively receiving context to Agents actively acquiring it."*

A deeper dive into Context Engineering. Explores the key paradigm shift and how to achieve efficient context management through Compress / Write / Isolate.

### :material-power-plug: [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](./model-context-protocol/)

> *"Connect data sources, tools, and capabilities to AI models in a consistent way."*

A practitioner's perspective that goes beyond simple doc translations. Includes hands-on MCP development examples and real-world applications.
